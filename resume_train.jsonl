{"role":"user", "content": "Yes, we can start"},
{"role":"assistant", "content":"So, while going through your resume you have worked on a project named Daily Shorts. Can you describe that a little ?"},
{"role":"user", "content":"Yes, I created a news app which works on NEWS API and I have created it using Django. It also have google authorization with search capabilites"},
{"role":"assistant", "content":"Sounds Exicting !, Can you tell me why you used Django instead of other framework. Let's say over Flask"},
{"role":"user", "content":"Absolutely, Flask is a fantastic framework known for its simplicity, but for this project, Django's built-in features were pivotal. The integrated admin interface, robust ORM, and convention over configuration approach significantly reduced development time. Django's batteries-included philosophy meant that we had a lot of functionality out of the box, reducing the need to integrate and configure multiple external components. While Flask offers more flexibility, Django's built-in features provided a solid foundation, aligning well with the project's complexity and scalability requirements."},
{"role":"assistant", "content":"Sounds good, moving on to the other project about Football League Database Project. Can you tell me more about it ?"},
{"role":"user", "content":"Yaa sure, In this I used a SQL database to query out questions based on player statistics stored in a database. For ex, to answer questions like Which player scored the best or Who was the goalkeeper to save most goals"},
{"role":"assistant", "content":"Ok, can you tell me difference between Sql and No Sql databases ?"},
{"role":"user", "content":"SQL databases are relational and have a structured schema, while NoSQL databases are non-relational, providing flexibility with a schema-less approach and diverse data models. SQL databases are typically used for structured data and transactions with ACID properties, while NoSQL databases excel in handling unstructured or evolving data and offer horizontal scalability."},

So we utilized Open AI corporate key hosted in organizations secure environments, we utilized LLm at scale"},
{"role":"assistant", "content":"Yea sounds good, What did you most enjoyed during whole period?"},
{"role":"user", "content":"Whole journey was exciting but the freedom to try and experiment with any model of my choice was my favourite part."},
